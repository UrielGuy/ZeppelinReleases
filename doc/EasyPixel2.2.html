<p>The EasyPixel 2.2 is an LED control board originally built for the LED Zeppelin project, but since reused for many other projects.
Some of its features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>32 LED channels, supporting the WS2812 protocol, with up to 1024 LEDs per channel</li>
<li>4 power banks, each with 5v to 24v support</li>
<li>Connector supporting up to 60A per power bank, and up to 10A per LED strip.</li>
<li>100mbps Ethernet communication</li>
<li>Support for static as well as DHCP IP assignment</li>
<li>A fuse for each LED strip</li>
<li>A test button for each led strip, displaying a test pattern</li>
<li>A fuse test button, showing the status of all the fuses</li>
<li>ID configurable by DIP switchs</li>
</ul>

<p>To configure the board, use the 8 position DIP switch next to the computing module. The pins are as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Position</th>
<th>Function</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>use DHCP when on, static IP when off</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Add 1 to the id of the controller</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Add 2 to the id of the controller</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>Add 4 to the id of the controller</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>Add 8 to the id of the controller</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>Add 16 to the id of the controller</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td>Add 32 to the id of the controller</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td>Add 64 to the id of the controller</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>DHCP, id is 5: switch on positions 1, 2, and 4</li>
<li>Static IP, id is 85: switch on positions 2, 4, 6, and 8</li>
</ul>

<p>To power the board, power bank #1 has to be powered. There are a couple of jumers close to strip #1. If the power is 5V, theyr should be
installed parallel to the short side of the board. If above 5V then parallel to the long side of the board.
<strong>Getting this wrong will premamnently damage your board!</strong></p>
<p>Each of the power banks can be supplied with any voltage you want. This voltage will be connected to the power pin for that bank. The
LED signal is always sent at 5V, through a 120Î© resistor.</p>
<p>The connector for each power bank is a XT60 connector, rated for 30A continous and 60A peak power supply.</p>
<h3 id="user-content-fuses"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" href="#user-content-fuses" id="user-content-fuses" name="user-content-fuses" tabindex="-1"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Fuses</h3>
<p>Each led channel is fused with a mini automotive fuse, with a default of 10A, matching the rating of the JST-VH connectors used for each
stip. You can change those to other, lower values if you have a different limitation in your setup, such as 3A JST-SM connectors (as many
LED strips come with).</p>
<p>To test the fuses, press the button next to each XT60 connector to see a green LED light up for each intact fuse.</p>
<h3 id="user-content-testing"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" href="#user-content-testing" id="user-content-testing" name="user-content-testing" tabindex="-1"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Testing</h3>
<p>Next to each strip there is a test switch. Turning the switch on will cause the strip to light up with a moving pattern lighting up every
10th LED. On some older versions this only works if the board detects a network connection to begin with. While in test mode, a red LED
will light next to the connector for the proper strip.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The LEDs update in a choppy way, starting and stopping every second or so - check that there is only a single controller with a given ID
on the network. Having multiple controller with the same ID will cause the software to alternate between them, causing both to look choppy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My LED strip wont light up - First, press the fuse test button and see hte green LED lights up next to the strip to indicate there is power.
Next, press the test button and see if the strip lights up then. If so, this is probably a configuration issue, or the curent mode has this
strip as "black". If it still hasn't lit up, try a different LED strip at the end of the cable. If that one lights up, the LED strip is faulty
If it stil doesn't light up, the cable you are using is porbably faulty, so please replace that.</p>
